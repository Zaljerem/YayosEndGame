# *** Add a new ending**




# *** About**

I was always dissatisfied with experiencing only one biome at Rimworld.
But it wasn't fun to travel the biomes for no reason.
This mod gives you a reason to travel to many biomes.

This story is a long epic.
We will settle for several years in each of the 3 biomes in rimworld, extract biome energy, 
and leave for a planet called by the unknown who created this teleporter.

# 1. Extract 100 biome energy shards from each of 3 biomes.

- Extracts energy shards from the biome.
  Depending on the working biome, the types of biome energy shards generated differ.
- So you have to travel through 3 biomes. (number can be modified in options.)

# 2. Make a planet energy core.

- A key material for building planet energy teleporters. To make this, you need biome energy shard.
- 3 types of biome shard required is randomly determined.

# 3. Build a planet energy teleporter.

- Lights from planetary energy shard explain this device.
  We figured out how to make this device and that it is a device for moving to another planet, 
  but we haven't figured out where this is pointing us.
  Those who made this seem to want us to come to them.

**Please take this mod and modify it. The source code is included.
I'd love to see variations come out with various ideas.
I'm a game designer, and I haven't implemented many ideas yet due to lack of time.
If you are proficient in C# and are interested, please contact me on the rimworld discord.**
